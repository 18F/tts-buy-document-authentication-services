## Background

The [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) program is undergoing significant modifications in direct response to recent laws passed in Congress and executive orders released by the Executive Office of the President instructing federal agencies to protect citizen data in transactions with the Government, including:

- The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) passed in October 2015;
- The Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP) released in March 2016 by the Executive Office of the President to identity short- and long-term actions to meet CISA; and
- The Implementation Plan Draft released in April 2016 as a plan for action to Executive Order 13681 - Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions.

### What we're hoping to end up with

Additional information is provided in Sections 2, 6, and 9 of the RFQ, but in short:

> The vendor will collect documentary evidence of identity data via the login.gov platform. The login.gov application will electronically transfer these data elements to the contractor. The contractor will return a real-time verification from the data received via the login.gov platform and the results of the comparison. Based on the response, GSA will determine whether documentary evidence meets our requirements as evidence of the individualâ€™s identity.
